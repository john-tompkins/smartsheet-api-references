# smartsheet-api-references
The goal of this repository is simply to catalogue different ways to interact with the Smartsheet API. Some are more complex than others. This also includes the Resource Management API as that is also poorly documented.

My goal is to add resources for those with more or less python skill who want to use Smartsheet/RM outside of the GUI.
